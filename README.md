# Note-Taker

## Description
The goal of this project was to modify starter code to create a Note Taker app to allow the user to write, save and delete notes.

I learnt how to use Express and Javascript to:
- Create API routes to GET, POST and DELETE notes
- To use Insomnia to test the API routes
- To use UUID npm package to create a unique ID to allow the deletion of the note
